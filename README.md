##  About Me

I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional on a mission to **secure the digital world/network** through research, innovation, and real-world application. My background includes L2 Security Operations, automating incident response workflows, building machine learning-based threat detection systems, analyzing malware, and hardening networks.

Recent tool - I engineered an **AI-Powered Automated Incident Response System** using DDoS Network logs, integrated with real-time dashboards, threat intelligence feeds, YARA detection rules, and automated firewall action responses.
